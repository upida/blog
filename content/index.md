          content: "Timeline depends on project scope and complexity. Small projects or features can take 1-2 weeks, medium projects typically 4-8 weeks, and larger applications can take 2-4 months or more. I provide detailed timeline estimates after an initial consultation."

          content: "I enjoy the full lifecycle of building products—from understanding user needs, designing intuitive interfaces, and implementing robust backends.
